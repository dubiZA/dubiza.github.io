      <description>The best way to learn is to do. You can read all you want about how to code in Python, create and run Docker containers, build a bookshelf or working with AWS; until you dig in and actually start experimenting, it&amp;rsquo;s not going to become a persistent skill. AWS is an incredible platform that is growing and innovating as a Cloud Services Provider in amazing ways. There are now over 250 services available through AWS, and that list grows bigger every year.</description>

      <description>Every time I set up a fresh install of an operating system as a result of a new computer or messing around with different OSes on existing systems, I end up having to set up the AWS CLI from scratch. I have multiple personal AWS accounts to use for learning and running services that I want on a more resilient platform than running them on a server at home. It&amp;rsquo;s always a pain to find the right doc pages for setting up the CLI with easy MFA assume role, so it&amp;rsquo;s time to document that here.</description>
