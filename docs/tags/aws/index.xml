      <description>AWS Well-Architected Framework A few month ago, I stumbled across some AWS provided resources in the form of labs that one can work through to better understand some of AWS recommended best practices. I don&amp;rsquo;t fully recall all the links I ended up finding (this is why the blog is being written - I know, browser bookmarks would also have been a good idea&amp;hellip;), but at least one of the places with some good labs to work through is https://wellarchitectedlabs.</description>

      <description>Every time I set up a fresh install of an operating system as a result of a new computer or messing around with different OSes on existing systems, I end up having to set up the AWS CLI from scratch. I have multiple personal AWS accounts to use for learning and running services that I want on a more resilient platform than running them on a server at home. It&amp;rsquo;s always a pain to find the right doc pages for setting up the CLI with easy MFA assume role, so it&amp;rsquo;s time to document that here.</description>
