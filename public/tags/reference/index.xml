      <description>This is the first post in what will be a multi-part series on some suggestions based on AWS Well-Architected Framework best practices focused on setting up an AWS account(s) for personal use and learning.
The best way to learn is to do. You can read all you want about how to code in Python, create and run Docker containers, build a bookshelf or work with AWS; until you dig in and actually start experimenting, it&amp;rsquo;s not going to become a persistent skill.</description>

      <description>Every time I set up a fresh install of an operating system as a result of a new computer or messing around with different OSes on existing systems, I end up having to set up the AWS CLI from scratch. I have multiple personal AWS accounts to use for learning and running services that I want on a more resilient platform than running them on a server at home. It&amp;rsquo;s always a pain to find the right doc pages for setting up the CLI with easy MFA assume role, so it&amp;rsquo;s time to document that here.</description>
