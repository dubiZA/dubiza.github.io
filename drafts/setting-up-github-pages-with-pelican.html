</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Over the last few days I have been trying to figure out how I want to go about chronicling my... accomplishments? I figured, if I'm going to spend time learning something, I should also invest some time documenting what I have learned for three reasons (in no particular order):</p>
<ul>
<li>So that I don't have to find all the sources out there on the web that lead to success all over again</li>
<li>With the hopes that it proves useful to someone out there in comming days</li>
<li>The stuff I've worked on stays in my head as a result of "writing it down" so to speak</li>
</ul>
<p>Setting up this site with GitHub Pages using Pelican (the Python based static site generator) and fronting it with Cloudflare's free tier CDN was enough of a challenge that it seems like a fantastic place to start writing. So, let's get started!</p>

<h1><a id="resources"></a>Resources I Used</h1>
<p>I followed two guides to get this to work:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://fedoramagazine.org/make-github-pages-blog-with-pelican/">Fedora Magazine</a> has a pretty solid write up that helped the most in figuring things out</li>
<li><a href="https://www.tomordonez.com/make-static-website-python-github-pages/">Tom Ordonez's</a> blog is where I found the Fedora Magazine reference and the idea to configure the GitHub Pages site with Cloudflare as CDN</li>
</ul>
<h1>Setting Up GitHub</h1>
<p>If you're not familiar with GitHub Pages, you can <a href="https://pages.github.com/" title="GitHub Pages">read more about it here</a>. In a nutshell, GitHub very generously offers to host "static" web content for you and/or your projects. No infrastructure to worry about. Extremely minimal configuration. The power of git workflow. A common use case for this is publishing personal/project blogs, for which, GitHub integrates with the Ruby based static site generator <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" title="Jekyll Static Site Generator">Jekyl</a>.</p>
<p>While I'm sure Jekyll is great, I'm a Python guy and decided to make the GitHub Pages (GHP) thing a tiny bit more complicated by using a Python based static site generator called <a href="https://blog.getpelican.com/" title="Pelican Python Static Site Generator">Pelican</a>. While GHP is capabile of automatically building the static files (HTML, etc.) when using Jekyll, choosing to use Pelican appears to mean doing things more manually (I say appears because I haven't actually looked further in to automating builds with anything else). To accomodate this manual process, two GitHub repos are suggested.</p>
<h2>Creating the Repos</h2>
<p>The <a href="#resources">Fedora Magazine</a> write up I followed suggests creating one GitHub repo named the way GHP requires, which is in the form <code>username.github.io</code> (follow the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site" title="GitHub Pages Docs">official GHP docs</a> if you are unsure how to do this). This is where the output files from Pelican will go. The name of the repo <strong>must exactly match</strong> <code>username.github.io</code> -- if it does not, GHP will not work. Make sure to initialize the repo with a readme. I left mine as a public repo.</p>
<p>I suppose the second repo name doesn't matter too much, but it is suggested to name it <code>username.github.io-src</code>. This repo will contain the source files used to generate the HTML, CSS, etc. I set mine up with a <code>.gitignore</code> for Python and, though it's probably not necessary, have it as a private repo.</p>
